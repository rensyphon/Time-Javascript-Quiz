# Time-Javascript-Quiz

## Description

This project created a programming quiz, written in Javascript, CSS, and HTML, with some Jquery added in. The program iterates through a list of questions, each with four possible options, while a timer counts down on screen. When the quiz ends, the user can enter a name and see their score, based on the number of correct answers.
